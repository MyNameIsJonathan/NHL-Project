# NHL Project
This project is intended as a means by which to report cool NHL statistics for the day's games.

My plan is to have the program, each morning, scrape NHL.com's games of the day, then probe the dataset created within this program to relay stats that may be of interest for those day's games. 

For example, the King's first game of the 2018-2019 season may cause the program to report that it is Ilya Kovalchuk's first game in 1500 or so days (after a 5-year stint in the KHL)

It's definitely worth noting here that my nascency to the use of git and github is on full display with ~100 commits. You have to start somewhere!
