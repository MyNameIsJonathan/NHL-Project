# NHL Project
  
This project is intended as a means by which to report cool NHL statistics for the day's games and can be accessed at https://jonathanolson.us

Consisting almost exclusively of Python, HTML, and CSS, this site's functionality of data collection is done by scraping daily NHL data from the web, before cleaning and reporting. The intent is to report both seasonal cumulative data and daily "interesting facts" about todays players, such as the player who has not scored a goal in the most games or hasn't scored an assist in the most days.

For example, the King's first game of the 2018-2019 season caused the program to report that it is Ilya Kovalchuk's first game in 1500 or so days (after a 5-year stint in the KHL). This was repeated for every day of the 2018-2019 season, continually scraping, cleaning, and reporting NHL data.
